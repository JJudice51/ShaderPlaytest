link to shadergraph intersection tutorial.

How to utilize Intersection shader:
1.	Download the ShaderPlaytest and attach it to your project
a.	Inside the ShaderPlaytest you will find 2 scenes one of which specifically shows of the capabilities of the Intersection ShaderGraph material
2.	Attach the IntersectionShaderMat found at Assets > Materials, to a 3D object
3.	Once attached if the 3d object crosses through any other object it should glow based on the options you select in the Inspector window on yout right
a.	Under the Surface Inputs you should see 2 things:
i.	IntersectionDepth – which changes how far away from the intersecting objects the one with the attached material glows
ii.	IntersectionColor – which changes the color of the indicated intersection.
Note: the SurfaceType for the IntersectionShaderMat must be Transparent for this shader to function as intended.
